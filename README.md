# ConesMilo

A mod for Project Zomboid that adds a large Milo tin. 

The Milo can be mixed in a water bottle with water or a milk carton with milk to create Milo Ais (Milo ice, common name for milo drink in Malaysia).
I borrowed the 3D mesh for CanofOats and pasted the Milo tin ribbon over the top. There seems to be a slight difference in the size of the tin when rendered in game though.
